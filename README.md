# Word Separator Script
This script processes a text file and separates each word onto a new line.

## Requirements
PowerShell version 3.0 or higher.
## Usage
Open PowerShell and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
Run the script by typing ./word-separator.ps1 and press Enter.
When prompted, enter the path to the text file you want to process.
The script will check if the file exists at the specified path. If the file exists, it will be processed and each word will be moved to a new line in the file. If the file does not exist, an error message will be displayed.
## Example

``` ./word-separator.ps1
Enter the path to the text file you want to process: C:\example\text.txt
Each word has been moved to a new line in the file successfully!```
